# Simple Bookstore RESTful API
## Description
A simple API to perform CRUD operations for a fictional bookstore using Typescript and Express.

## Requirements
This project was made using `npm 10.7.0` and `npx 10.7.0`.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dewet99/octoco-bookstore-api
    ```
2. Get all the packages as listed in package-lock.json:
    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

3. Run the following inside the cloned repo:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4. It will be hosted on localhost, port 3000. You can then start doing CRUD requests, or navigate to the displayed link and the endpoints as described in the assignment sheet.

## Usage
1. The server is populated with some data, defined in `tests/testBooks.ts`, just so you don't need to manually add data for testing API functionality.

2. You can run unit tests with `npm test`. The unit tests also use the test data.

3. The functionality specified in the task document is all there and working, all examples from the document can be performed.
